PySAT integrates a number of widely used state-of-the-art SAT solvers. All the
provided solvers are the original low-level implementations installed along
with PySAT. Note that the solvers' source code *is not* a part of the project's
source tree and is downloaded and patched at every PySAT installation.

Currently, the following SAT solvers are supported (at this point, for
Minisat-based solvers only *core* versions are integrated):

-  Glucose (`3.0 <http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/>`__)
-  Glucose (`4.1 <http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/>`__)
-  Lingeling (`bbc-9230380-160707 <http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/>`__)
-  Minicard (`1.2 <https://github.com/liffiton/minicard>`__)
-  Minisat (`2.2 release <http://minisat.se/MiniSat.html>`__)
-  Minisat (`GitHub version <https://github.com/niklasso/minisat>`__)

In order to make SAT-based prototyping easier, PySAT integrates a variety of
cardinality encodings. All of them are implemented from scratch in C++. The
list of cardinality encodings included is the following:

-  pairwise [7]_
-  bitwise [7]_
-  sequential counters [8]_
-  sorting networks [3]_
-  cardinality networks [1]_
-  ladder [4]_
-  totalizer [2]_
-  modulo totalizer [6]_
-  iterative totalizer [5]_
